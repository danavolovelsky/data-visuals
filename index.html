            <p>Welcome to an in-depth exploration of the evolution of music genres from the 1950s to the 2000s. This
                project explores the rich history of music, highlighting the trends, shifts, and connections that have
                shaped the musical world over the decades. Through a series of visualisations, you'll gain a
                comprehensive understanding of how music has transformed and influenced our culture. <br><br>
                <b>Line Graphs:</b> These graphs will illustrate the rise and fall of genre popularity over the
                decades, providing a clear view of musical trends and shifts.<br>
                <b>Timeline:</b> A representation of key moments and changes in music history through a timeline,
                highlight the progression of musical styles and popularities.<br>
                <b>Compatibility Table:</b> Discover the relationships between different musical genres and
                how they have evolved and intertwined over time. This table will reveal the connections and influences
                that have shaped the sound of contemporary music.<br><br>
                This project goes beyond data and charts to offer valuable insights into the cultural and societal
                factors that have driven these changes. By exploring these visualisations, you will go on a journey
                through music history, gaining a deeper appreciation for the creativity and expression that define each
                genre. This project is all about uncovering the stories behind the music and understanding the intricate
                web of
                influences that have left a significant mark on our musical heritage.</p>
